GROUP PROJECT PROPOSAL[a]
CSCI-136 (PYTHON)
FALL 2021




Group # & Member Names:
Group 14:
Ayomide Okeshola
Julian Francis


Project Idea:
We will build a small-scale, minimalist 2D platformer game, compatible with keyboard/most Xinput controllers — featuring a sandbox level along with a linear level.
Placeholder project name: Cubeb


Project Value Proposition:
Cubeb revolves around the passion of game-making and finding out the struggle that comes with it. We want to understand and better appreciate what makes being a gamedev, and we want to make an entertaining application in the process.
There are plenty of similar existing projects out in the woodworks, and we hope to make our project unique by making the game with smooth, accessible controls in mind.


Project Technology:
We plan to use PyGame (https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer) for development, with the project’s code open-sourced on GitHub.
Various itch.io freeware gamedev assets may be used in the process of designing the linear level.
We’ll find royalty-free music on YouTube, as neither of us are music majors.




Project Planning:[b]
We will communicate with each other through GitHub and SMS Messaging, presumably on every Friday or Saturday. This meet-up time is prone to change depending on our individual projects at the time. 
To discuss progress and updates with the instructor, we will meet up on Tuesdays 10:15-10:30 am. 


Both of us will work on the game engine/level design but Ayomide will specialize on art and music assets in particular.


The calendar invite was created for the aforementioned meet-up.




Project Challenges:
Learning how to make a game along with crushing all bugs related to physics/collision will be the biggest challenge; the second biggest challenge will likely be the scope of the project-how to design the sandbox/linear levels in a reasonable timeframe.
We will approach this challenge with copious amounts of YouTube video guides, and making changes to our project scope as we see fit-while communicating with the course instructor.


Project Milestones:
Milestones & Timelines:
1. Learn How to create/design our game (1-3 weeks)
2. Design the Cubeb interface (1 week)
3. Coding for Cubeb (2 weeks)
4. Finalize Cubeb (2 weeks)
5. Final Presentation & Writeup (2 weeks)

[b]What times will the team meet weekly to discuss progress and updates? Who will work on what?
If possible, choose a 20 minute slot from the office hour time slots from the link below:

Set up a calendar invite for the time slot using calendar.google.com and invite saurav.aryal@bison.howard.edu.


Eg, We plan to meet weekly Tuesdays (10-10:20 am) to discuss updates and progress. The work will be divided: personA does task 1, personB does task 2, and personC does task 3. The calendar event has been created and the provided email has been invited.
