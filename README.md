# Cubeb
## PyGame group project made for Computer Science II (Python) @ Howard University [CSCI 136-02 Fall 2021, Group #14]

Hello! This is Cubeb, soon being the repository for a 2D platformer game made using the PyGame library.

Current outline for week of 10/10/21 is to figure out how in the world PyGame works, then we will make basic functions to get SOMETHING running.
